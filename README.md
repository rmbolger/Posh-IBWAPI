# Description

This PowerShell module makes it easier to automate Infoblox WAPI requests and functions. It is not intended to wrap every object into a set of custom cmdlets or strong types. Instead, it aims to hide some of the tedious complexity in calling the Infoblox REST API via PowerShell.

# Notable Features

- [Powershell Core](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) 6.0+ support!
- Automatic paging for large GET result sets *(Requires WAPI version 1.5+)*
- Optionally return all fields for an object without needing to specify each one individually *(Requires WAPI version 1.7.5+)*
- Use `Get-IBSchema` for `Get-Help` style querying of the WAPI object model *(Requires WAPI version 1.7.5+)*. *See [guide](https://github.com/rmbolger/Posh-IBWAPI/wiki/Guide-to-Get-IBSchema) for details.*
- Error details in the body of HTTP 400 responses are exposed instead of being swallowed by Invoke-RestMethod.
- Pipeline support so you can do things like pass the results from `Get-IBObject` directly to `Remove-IBObject`.
- Optionally ignore certificate validation errors.
- Save common connection parameters per-session with `Set-IBWAPIConfig` so you don't need to pass them to every function call.
- Use `Save-IBWAPIConfig` to persist connection parameters between sessions.
- In multi-grid or multi-host environments, connection parameters can be saved separately for each WAPI host.

# Install

The [latest release version](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Posh-IBWAPI) can found in the PowerShell Gallery. Installing from the gallery requires the PowerShellGet module which is installed by default on Windows 10 or later. See the *Getting Started with the Gallery* section at https://www.powershellgallery.com/ for instructions on earlier OSes. Zip/Tar versions can also be downloaded from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/rmbolger/Posh-IBWAPI/releases).

```powershell
# install for all users (requires elevated privs)
Install-Module -Name Posh-IBWAPI

# install for current user
Install-Module -Name Posh-IBWAPI -Scope CurrentUser
```

To install the latest *development* version from the git master branch, use the following command in PowerShell v3 or later. This method assumes a default Windows PowerShell or PowerShell Core environment that includes the [`PSModulePath`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd878326.aspx) environment variable which contains a reference to `$HOME\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules` or `$HOME/.local/share/powershell/Modules`. You must also make sure `Get-ExecutionPolicy` is not set to `Restricted` or `AllSigned`.

```powershell
# (optional) set less restrictive execution policy
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -Force

# install latest dev version
iex (invoke-restmethod https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmbolger/Posh-IBWAPI/master/instdev.ps1)
```



# Quick Start

Every WAPI call needs a host, version, and credentials. Set them once for the session with `Set-IBWAPIConfig` and you won't need to add them to every call. If your grid is still using self-signed certs, you may also need to use the `-IgnoreCertificateValidation` parameter. In addition to standard version numbers like `'2.2'`, the `-WAPIVersion` parameter also accepts `'latest'` and will query the grid master for the latest supported version.

```powershell
Set-IBWAPIConfig -host gridmaster.example.com -version latest -cred (Get-Credential) -IgnoreCert
```

Retrieve a set of objects using `Get-IBObject`. The only required parameter is `-ObjectType`. Everything else like filters and return fields are optional.

```powershell
Get-IBObject -type record:host
Get-IBObject -type record:host -Filters "name~=example.com" -Max 10 -fields extattrs
```

If you're just exploring the WAPI object model, it can be helpful to convert the resulting objects back to JSON for readability.

```powershell
Get-IBObject -type record:host | Select -First 1 | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 5
```

You may notice that all objects returned by Infoblox have a `_ref` field. That is known as the object reference and can be used in any function that accepts `-ObjectRef`. In the case of `Get-IBObject`, it will return that specific object.

```powershell
Get-IBObject -ref 'record:host/asdfqwerasdfqwerasdfqwerasdfqwer'
```

Create a new object with `New-IBObject`. All you need to provide is the object type and an object with the minimum required fields defined. Embedded WAPI functions work just fine here.

```powershell
# Build the record:host object we want to create.
# NOTE: An error will be thrown if the example.com DNS zone doesn't
# exist in Infoblox
$newhost = @{name='web1.example.com';comment='web server'}
$newhost.ipv4addrs = @( @{ipv4addr='10.10.10.1'} )

# Create the object
New-IBObject -type record:host -IBObject $newhost

# Modify the object so we can make another and this time use an
# embedded function to set the IP address.
$newhost.name = 'web2.example.com'
$newhost.ipv4addrs = @( @{ipv4addr='func:nextavailableip:10.10.10.0/24'} )
New-IBObject -type record:host -IBObject $newhost
```

To modify an object, the easiest way is usually to get a copy of it, modify the copy, and save the result with `Set-IBObject`. *Be wary of objects that return read-only fields. You need to strip them out before saving or an error will be thrown.*

```powershell
# Get a copy of the host
$myhost = Get-IBObject -type record:host -Filters 'name=web1.example.com'

# Modify the first listed IP address
$myhost.ipv4addrs[0] = @{ ipv4addr='10.10.10.100' }

# remove the read-only 'host' field from the nested 'record:host_ipv4addr' object
$myhost.ipv4addrs[0].PSObject.Properties.Remove('host')

# Save the result
$myhost | Set-IBObject
```

If you need to make the same change to a set of objects, you can also pass the set of object references via the pipeline and use a template object to change all of them in the same way.

```powershell
# Get all hosts in the Los Angeles site
$laHosts = Get-IBObject -type record:host -Filters '*Site=Los Angeles'

# Move them to the New York site
$laHosts | Set-IBObject -Template @{extattrs=@{Site=@{value='New York'}}}
```

Deleting one or more objects is as simple as passing one or more object references to `Remove-IBObject`.

```powershell
# Get hosts being decommissioned
$toDelete = Get-IBObject -type record:host -Filters 'comment=decommission'

# Delete them
$toDelete | Remove-IBObject
```
